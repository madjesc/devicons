# Devicons
This is my fork of "Nonicons" and "Octicons"

# Generate the font
Use the script `generate.py` to generate a ttf file with only the icons. This is cool for using this font as a fallback

# Patching a font
If you can't use this font as a fallback you can patch your font

Use `patch.py` to add the glyps to the selected fonts
```sh
python3 patch.py FONT_PATH OUT
```
